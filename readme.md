Job Opening Tracker Program.

The goal of this project is to be able to go out and get job opening on company websites. 

Be able to then filter by companies, locations, job titles, descriptions of jobs, and when a job was posted.

Be able to send alerts to when a new job has been posted. To either an email address or cell phone. 

Structure would need to be built.

Set up a System that would automatically apply to jobs. 

Create a resume builder System.
